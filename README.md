A website that features experiences and stats of Bellevue School District alumni to help current high school students with college applications.
Gave a oairing system where BSD alumni can apply to become a mentor and a high school student can apply to be a mentee.
The paired mentor and mentee will be a team where the mentor will guide the mentee by answering questions, recommending activities, reading essays, etc.
