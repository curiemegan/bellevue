# Bellevue
A website that features experiences and stats of Bellevue School District(BSD) alumni to help current high school students with college applications.
Gave a pairing system where BSD alumni can apply to become a mentor and a high school student can apply to be a mentee.
The paired mentor and mentee will form a team, such that the mentor will offer guidance to the mentee by answering questions, recommending activities, and peer reviewing essays, etc.
